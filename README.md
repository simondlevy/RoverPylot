Pilot the Brookstone Rover 2.0 and Rover Revolution from Python

<h2>Instructions</h2>	

This repository contains a Python API and demo	
program allowing you to control the Brookstone 	
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rover-2-0-App-Controlled-Wireless-Tank/dp/B0093285XK">	
Rover 2.0 spy tank</a> and <a	
href="http://www.amazon.com/Rover-Revolution-App-Controlled-Wireless-Vehicle/dp/B00GLVXM70/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1421113202&sr=1-1&keywords=brookstone+rover+revolution">Rover	
Revolution</a> spy vehicle from your laptop or PC. To get started, you should	
get hold of a 	
Rover 2.0 or Revolution (of course) and a Playstation PS3 controller or clone, and install the repository	
(<b>sudo python setup.py install</b> for Linux users), as well as	
<a href="http://pygame.org/news.html">PyGame</a> and either <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> for Python	
(Rover 2.0) or <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> (Rover Revolution). 	
Join the Rover's ad-hoc wifi network from your computer.	
Then run either the <b>ps3rover20.py</b> or <b>ps3revolution.py</b> script from the repository.  This script will	
allow you to drive the Rover around and watch its streaming video, as shown	
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsRleC1ediU">here</a>.  I have	
run this script successfully on Linux (Ubuntu),	
but I can't vouch for what happens on Windows or OS X, on which Python packages	
become much trickier. Remember, the Rover 20 is a tank, so you	
control it by moving the left and right sticks back and forth. If you used an inexpensive clone of the	
P3 controller you may have to do some adjusting of	
the axis and button settings at the top of the script to make it work.

Once you're up and running with the <b>ps3rover.py</b> or  <b>ps3revolution.py</b> script, look at its 	
source code (and run pydoc on <b>rover.py</b>) to see how RoverPylot works and	
how you can modify it to do other interesting things.

<h2>Known issues</h2>	



<ol>	

<li> The  <b>ps3rover20.py</b> script will report a harmless error about extraneous bytes in the JPEG image.	
<p>	
<li> The  <b>ps3revolution.py</b> script will often show a blurred/smudged image. This happens because, whereas	
the Rover 2.0 sends JPEG images, the Revolution sends <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264 video</a>.	
I couldn't find a Python package for decoding and displaying H.264 on the fly, so I wrote little workaround that 	
saves the video to a temporary file, which	
from which the script then reads.  You can tweak the performance of this setup by playing with the <tt>FRAMERATE</tt>	
and <tt>DELAY_SEC</tt> parameters at the top of the script.	
</ol>	


<h2>Tips for Windows</h2>	

Rob Crawley has put a lot of work into getting RoverPylot to work smoothly on Windows 10.  Here are his changes:	
<ol> 	

<li> Original:<br>	

<tt># Create a named temporary file for video stream<br>	
tmpfile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()</tt><br><br>	
Changed to:<br>	
<tt>tmpfile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+b', bufsize=0 , suffix='.avi', prefix='RoverRev', dir='\Python27\RoverRev_WinPylot', delete=False)</tt>	
<p><li> Original:<br>	
<tt># Wait a few seconds, then being playing the tmp video file<br>	
cmd = 'ffplay -window_title Rover_Revolution -framerate %d %s' % (FRAMERATE, tmpfile.name)</tt><br><br>	
Changed to:<br>	
<tt>	
cmd = '/Python27/ffmpeg/bin/ffplay.exe -x 640 -y 480 -window_title Rover_Revolution -framerate %d %s' % (FRAMERATE, tmpfile.name)</tt>	

</ol>
